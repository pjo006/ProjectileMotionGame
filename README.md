# ProjectileMotionGame
Projectile motion game designed and built by the Bucknell senior design team of Dale Hartman, PJ Onusconich, Eben Blaisdell, and Sean McDonough for the Lewisburg Children's Museum.

This project was created at the request of Professor Erin Jablonski for the Lewisburg Children's Museum. Our group was tasked to create a game that would engage the young audience of the musuem and help them develop an understanding of physical concepts. We decided to use Unity to create a projectile motion game with varying gravitational effects. A full overview of the design process can be viewed in the Final Report pdf.

There are a lot of test builds added to the repository to allow our team to remotely access new builds. The imporant elements of the project are the directories required to run the unity project and the arduino directory containing the code for our custom arduino based gamepad.
